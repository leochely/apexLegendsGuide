								<h2>Octane</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/octaneLegend.png" alt="" /> </span>Octane is the key legend of this team composition. While all the safe spots can be accessed with Pathfinder, the zipline reveals your team position or the other 2 team members have to find somewhere else to hide.</p>
							<p>The Launch Pads allow your team to reach tricky hidding spots and can be destroyed afterwards! Once all the team is hidden, you can remove the launch pad by shooting on it. The cooldown of that ability is very short so you can also use it to escape fights as well. You can also try other spots that are not marked on our map, feel free to contact us if you find new ones!</p>
							<p>Octane is a very good legend when it comes to escaping fights. You can spam your Stim to increase your speed and run away from a fight. You cannot die from that ability so if you feel confident enough (or you do not have the choice), you can still use it at very low health.</p>

								<h2>Pathfinder</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/pathfinderLegend.png" alt="" /></span>Despite the hook nerf in season 5, Pathfinder remains a viable option for the hidding strategy. Its zipline allow to travel faster between jump towers and the grappling hook can be useful to escape dangerous situations. With the increased cooldown, you now have to be careful so the ability is ready when you are under fire.</p>
							<p>Pathfinder's passive is very powerful when you play the hidding strategy. Make sure to use it whenever you can. Getting zone intel from a beacon is the <b>only</b> reason to leave a safe spot after making sure it does not reveal your position.</p>
							<p>Some hidding spots are only accessible to Pathfinder. Do not use the zipline to reach them since they reveal your position to ennemies. You must therefore practice using your grappling hook to reach these spots: the more time you spend trying to hide, the more likely another team will find you and engage a fight.</p>

								<h2>Bloodhound</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/bloodhoundLegend.png" alt="" /></span>Bloodhound is not mandatory in this team compostion and can be replaced by Crypto if you still want a recon character. Bloodhound can escape a fight with the increased speed of Beast of the Hunt. However, Bloodhound main use in the hidding strategy is to prevent fights: the Tracker reveals footprints of ennemies so you know if there is a threat around.</p>
							<p>The Eye of the Allfather should be used whenever approaching a dangerous area. There can be enemies in buildings are obtaining that information can allow you to change your path before a fight starts.</p>
							<p>When playing as Bloodhound, you must realize that you are not an esssential element of the hidding strategy. Your presence is not required to access the safe spots so you have to make sure the other team members are staying alive. Yes that means you have to act as a bait if needed.</p>
